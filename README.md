## StormRaiser's Cellular Automata

Course project for "Fundations of Programming and Algorithm" course (2013 fall).

Co-authored with Wan Jun & Wu Zhelun.

This is a cellular automata simulator. Supports infinite grid. Customizable life-like/generations/margolus/reaction-diffusion rules and some hard-coded rules. The rule part is designed to be extensible so other rules may be easily added with new code.

Basic functions mostly work. Contains lots of incomplete features and presumably lots of bugs as well. Maybe I will rewrite the code someday.
